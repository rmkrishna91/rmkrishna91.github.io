summary: "A walkthrough of how to replicate ChatGPT-style interactions using Meta's LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct model and Hugging Face's Transformers library."
---

This blog post demonstrates how to replicate the behavior of ChatGPT using Meta’s **LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct** model through the 🤗 Hugging Face `transformers` library.

In this educational walkthrough, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a text generation pipeline
- Format system/user prompts using a custom chat template
- Tokenize input using LLaMA’s tokenizer
- Generate and decode model responses
- Peek into model internals: weights, tokenizer settings, generation configs

> 📌 **Use Case**: Ideal for learners and developers curious about how instruction-following LLMs like ChatGPT work under the hood.

### 🔧 Requirements

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- Hugging Face account with access token

### 🚀 Model Used

`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`

## 🔍 LLMs Behind the API Key

### 💬 ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a **Large Language Model (LLM)** developed by **OpenAI**, built on the **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** architecture. It’s designed to generate human-like responses to text input, making it versatile for a range of tasks like answering questions, providing recommendations, and even engaging in casual conversation.

By leveraging extensive training on diverse datasets, ChatGPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant replies based on the input it receives.

> 🖼️ *In the screenshot below, you’ll see an example of how users interact with ChatGPT by asking it a question, and how it responds using its pre-trained knowledge.*

## 🚀 From ChatGPT to the Hugging Face Pipeline: The Inner Workings

While ChatGPT provides an easy-to-use interface for interacting with a language model, there’s a lot happening behind the scenes. To understand how the magic works, let’s dive deeper into how large language models (LLMs) are deployed using frameworks like Hugging Face’s `transformers` library.

### 🤗 Hugging Face

**Hugging Face** is an open-source platform and community for Natural Language Processing (NLP), offering a vast collection of pre-trained models and tools to streamline AI development.

Its `transformers` library provides easy access to cutting-edge large language models like **GPT**, **BERT**, and **LLaMA** for tasks such as:

- ✅ Text generation
- ✅ Classification
- ✅ Translation
- ✅ Question answering

### 🦙 Using the Meta LLaMA Instruct Model with Hugging Face

To replicate the internal workings of ChatGPT, we use **Meta's LLaMA Instruct model**, particularly the **LLaMA 3.2 1B** version — fine-tuned for instruction-following tasks.

This model is designed to:

- Understand system/user prompts
- Generate responses based on context
- Handle conversational flows

### 🧪 Loading LLaMA Instruct 3.2 1B in Hugging Face's Text Generation Pipeline

Let’s now look at how to load and use the **LLaMA Instruct** model with Hugging Face's `pipeline()` function for text generation.

> 🔍 This gives us a close approximation to how ChatGPT-style systems work under the hood!

### 🔐 Step 1: Authenticate with Hugging Face

To use Hugging Face models, you need to authenticate using your personal access token:


```python
from huggingface_hub import login
# Replace 'your_access_token' with your actual Hugging Face token
login("your_access_token")
```
{% raw %}
The token has not been saved to the git credentials helper. Pass `add_to_git_credential=True` in this function directly or `--add-to-git-credential` if using via `huggingface-cli` if you want to set the git credential as well.
Token is valid (permission: write).
Your token has been saved to /root/.cache/huggingface/token
Login successful
{% endraw %}
