summary: "A walkthrough of how to replicate ChatGPT-style interactions using Meta's LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct model and Hugging Face's Transformers library."
---

This blog post demonstrates how to replicate the behavior of ChatGPT using Meta‚Äôs **LLaMA 3.2 1B Instruct** model through the ü§ó Hugging Face `transformers` library.

In this educational walkthrough, you'll learn how to:

- Set up a text generation pipeline
- Format system/user prompts using a custom chat template
- Tokenize input using LLaMA‚Äôs tokenizer
- Generate and decode model responses
- Peek into model internals: weights, tokenizer settings, generation configs

> üìå **Use Case**: Ideal for learners and developers curious about how instruction-following LLMs like ChatGPT work under the hood.

### üîß Requirements

- `transformers`
- `torch`
- Hugging Face account with access token

### üöÄ Model Used

`meta-llama/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct`

## üîç LLMs Behind the API Key

### üí¨ ChatGPT

ChatGPT is a **Large Language Model (LLM)** developed by **OpenAI**, built on the **GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)** architecture. It‚Äôs designed to generate human-like responses to text input, making it versatile for a range of tasks like answering questions, providing recommendations, and even engaging in casual conversation.

By leveraging extensive training on diverse datasets, ChatGPT can generate coherent and contextually relevant replies based on the input it receives.

> üñºÔ∏è *In the screenshot below, you‚Äôll see an example of how users interact with ChatGPT by asking it a question, and how it responds using its pre-trained knowledge.*
