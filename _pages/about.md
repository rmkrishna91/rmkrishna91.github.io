I am a second-year postgraduate student pursuing a Master of Technology in Artificial Intelligence at NIT Silchar, India.

My research interests include Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Generative AI, and Agentic AI.

I am currently working on my master's thesis in the field of NLP and Generative AI.

I am also passionate about assisting others on their journey in AI, Machine Learning, and academia.

I have published research in leading AI conferences, including EMNLP, COLING, and HCI, focusing on AI-generated text detection, low-resource language translation, and AI alignment

I interned at Bosch Global Software Technologies, developing LLM-based chatbots and agents for real-time Q&A on signal data.

I also worked as a research intern at AIISC (University of South Carolina), focusing on AI alignment and enhancing the robustness of large language models.
