## AI Data Analyst Chatbot 🤖📊  
This project introduces an **AI-Powered Data Analyst Chatbot** that allows you to:  
- 📂 **Upload CSV files** and explore them interactively.  
- 💬 **Ask questions using natural language** to analyze data.  
- 🎨 **Visualize data** dynamically with plots and heatmaps.  

---

### How It Works  
1. 📂 **Upload a CSV File**: Upload your dataset to start the analysis.  
2. 💬 **Ask Anything!**  
   - “Check for missing values.”  
   - “Show a correlation heatmap.”  
   - “Plot a histogram of column X.”  
3. 📊 **Get Results and Plots Instantly**: AI interprets your query and generates the results.
